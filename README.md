## DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK

Introduction:
Data encryption is a pillar of modern cybersecurity practices. Protecting sensitive information through strong encryption techniques prevents unauthorized access and ensures privacy. For this task, a file encryption and decryption tool using AES-256 encryption was built using Python‚Äôs cryptography library.

Working Principle:

Key Generation:
A secure symmetric encryption key is generated and saved securely.

Encryption:
Given a file, the tool encrypts its contents and saves a new .enc encrypted version.

Decryption:
Users can decrypt any .enc file back to its original form using the saved key.

The tool uses Fernet encryption from the cryptography module, which internally applies AES-256.

Key Features:

AES-256 Standard Security:
One of the strongest symmetric encryption algorithms known.

Easy Key Management:
Keys are generated and stored in a separate secret.key file.

User Friendly CLI:
Provides options for generating a key, encrypting, or decrypting files with minimal effort.

Importance: Encryption is essential to protect personal data, financial records, medical data, intellectual property, and more. Without strong encryption, data at rest or data in transit is extremely vulnerable to theft, espionage, or leakage.

Use Cases:

Encrypting confidential documents on laptops.

Securing backups on USB drives.

Protecting sensitive logs and configuration files in cloud storage.

Technologies Used:

Python

Cryptography (Fernet - AES-256)

Future Enhancements:

GUI (Graphical User Interface) for more friendly file selections.

Encrypt entire folders recursively.

Password-protected decryption keys.

Conclusion: This Advanced Encryption Tool successfully shows how to implement military-grade encryption standards in Python with simplicity and reliability. It makes high-end security accessible even for beginner-level users and emphasizes the importance of data confidentiality.
